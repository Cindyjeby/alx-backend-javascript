ES6 Basics
ES6, or ECMAScript 2015, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard, which is the specification that JavaScript is based on. ES6 was a major update to the language and introduced many new features and improvements to JavaScript. Some of the notable features introduced in ES6 include:
1. Arrow Functions: A concise syntax for writing anonymous functions
2. Let and Const Declarations: Introduces block-scoped variables with let and constants with const.
3. Template Literals: A more flexible way to concatenate strings and embed expressions inside them.
4. Destructuring Assignment: Allows extracting values from arrays or objects and assigning them to variables in a concise way.
5. Default Parameters: Allows providing default values for function parameters.
6. Rest and Spread Operators: The rest operator (...) gathers elements into an array, and the spread operator (...) spreads elements from an array
7. Classes: A more convenient way to create constructor functions and prototype-based inheritance.
8. Modules: Introduces a standardized way to organize and structure code by using import and export statements.
9. Promises: A more robust and flexible alternative to callbacks for handling asynchronous operations.
10. Arrow Functions: Provide a shorter syntax for writing function expressions.
These features have become widely adopted in modern JavaScript development and have significantly improved the readability and maintainability of code
